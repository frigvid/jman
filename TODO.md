# Levels

- Level class.
  - Saves level data into a Level object.
  - Parses level data from file.
- Level Builder.
  - Takes a level object.
  - Uses methods like `.addWalls()` to, well, add the walls. Which will let you comment it out, to skip the walls. Other methods should be used too, like adding AI or not.
    - This should be capable enough to still place things in their correct positions if you skip a part of the build process.
